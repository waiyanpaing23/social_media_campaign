                    <h2>Legislation</h2>
                    <p>Navigating the world of social media requires a solid understanding of relevant legislation designed to protect users and maintain a safe online environment.
                        The following key laws and regulations are essential for ensuring your rights and responsibilities are respected when using social media platforms.</p>
                    <p><strong>Data Protection Laws:</strong> Data protection laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy
                        Act (CCPA) in the United States, are designed to give individuals control over their personal data. These laws require social media platforms to be transparent
                        about how they collect, use, and share user data. They also provide users with rights to access, correct, and delete their data, as well as the right to opt-out
                        of data processing activities. Understanding these laws can help you better manage your privacy and protect your personal information online.</p>

                    <p><strong>Cyberbullying Laws:</strong> Cyberbullying is a growing concern on social media, and many countries have enacted laws to combat this issue. These laws
                        vary by jurisdiction but generally aim to protect individuals from harassment, threats, and harmful behavior online. For example, some jurisdictions have
                        specific anti-cyberbullying laws that make it illegal to use electronic communication to intimidate or harass others. Familiarizing yourself with these laws
                        can help you recognize and report cyberbullying, ensuring a safer online experience for everyone.</p>
